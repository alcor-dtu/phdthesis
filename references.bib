abstract="Existing techniques for interactive rendering of deformable translucent objects can accurately compute diffuse but not directional subsurface scattering effects. It is currently a common practice to gain efficiency by storing maps of transmitted irradiance. This is, however, not efficient if we need to store elements of irradiance from specific directions. To include changes in subsurface scattering due to changes in the direction of the incident light, we instead sample incident radiance and store scattered radiosity. This enables us to accommodate not only the common distance-based analytical models for subsurface scattering but also directional models. In addition, our method enables easy extraction of virtual point lights for transporting emergent light to the rest of the scene. Our method requires neither preprocessing nor texture parameterization of the translucent objects. To build our maps of scattered radiosity, we progressively render the model from different directions using an importance sampling pattern based on the optical properties of the material. We obtain interactive frame rates, our subsurface scattering results are close to ground truth, and our technique is the first to include interactive transport of emergent light from deformable translucent objects.",

abstract = {Transparent objects require acquisition modalities that are very different from the ones used for objects with more diffuse reflectance properties. Digitizing a scene where objects must be acquired with different modalities requires scene reassembly after reconstruction of the object surfaces. This reassembly of a scene that was picked apart for scanning seems unexplored. We contribute with a multimodal digitization pipeline for scenes that require this step of reassembly. Our pipeline includes measurement of bidirectional reflectance distribution functions and high dynamic range imaging of the lighting environment. This enables pixelwise comparison of photographs of the real scene with renderings of the digital version of the scene. Such quantitative evaluation is useful for verifying acquired material appearance and reconstructed surface geometry, which is an important aspect of digital content creation. It is also useful for identifying and improving issues in the different steps of the pipeline. In this work, we use it to improve reconstruction, apply analysis by synthesis to estimate optical properties, and to develop our method for scene reassembly.},

  abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

  abstract = {A new method for getting range pictures and segmentation algorithms for 3-D object recognition is considered. A gray-coded pattern projector is used for space-encoding, and a CCD video camera is used for getting the image. Instead of scanning a light slit at 2n positions in turn, only n patterns are required for space-encoding. As the gray-code has the property that the Hamming distance between the two adjacent numbers is always one, the ambiguity on the boundary of the projection pattern can be limited to within ÃÂ±1 LSB width. Experimental results are presented. For 3-D object recognition, a segmentation process is important as well as surface fitting. An algorithm called ring operator for segmenting an image into regions is also described.},
