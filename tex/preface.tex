\chapter{Preface}

The work from this Ph.D. thesis was carried under the Section for Image Analysis and Computer Graphics, at the Department for Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (DTU Compute) at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). This thesis was prepared in fulfillment of the requirements to obtain a doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in computer science. The work presented was funded on a DTU Compute internal scholarship. 

This thesis deals with the topic of bringing techniques from photorealistic offline rendering into the interactive and real time domain. To achieve this goal, a set of publications was produced over the course of the studies. The publications are summarized at page~\pageref{sec:contributionlist}. Relevant  publications for this thesis are available for the sake of the reader in Appendices~\ref{sec:firstcontribution}-\ref{sec:mertensnote}. From these, a total of five peer reviewed publications have been included in this thesis (\ref{sec:firstcontribution}-\ref{sec:lastcontribution}), while two (X-XI) have been left out as not relevant to the overall thesis topic. Moreover, during the course of the Ph.D. some notes were produced. These notes are reported as non peer reviewed material and attached in Appendices~\ref{sec:jensennote}-\ref{sec:mertensnote}. 

The work has been carried under the main supervision of Associate Professor Jeppe Eliot Revall Frisvad, with the co-supervision of Associate Professor Andreas B\ae rentzen. The research activities have mostly been conducted at DTU, with the exception of two external research stay periods. The first research stay was an internship at NVIDIA Corporation, under managers Aaron Lefohn and David Luebke, in the real time rendering research team based in Redmond, Washington, USA. The second external research stay was under the supervision of Professor Toshiya Hachisuka, Department of Creative Informatics, The University of Tokyo.
