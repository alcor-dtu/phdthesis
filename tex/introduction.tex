\section{Scope}

\section{Motivation}

As we have discussed in Section TODO, many efforts have been made both in the offline and real time rendering community to achieve photorealistically accurate images. In the former community, more emphasis is put in achieving phisycal accuracy, while in the latter immediate feedback and performance are of foremost importance.

In recent year, we have discussed how recent advantages in GPU power and interactive ray tracing are bringing phisically based rendering into the interactive domain.
