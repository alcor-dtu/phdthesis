\chapter{Contributions}

In this section we will tie together the different publications made during the course of the PhD studies. We will focus on the general message of the publications in relation to the goal of the PhD. We remand to the full text of the individual publications in Appendices~ \ref{sec:glass}-\ref{sec:vrbrdf} for the full technical details.

\section{Motivation}
(Figure: Fields in which we need instant feedback on appearance: 3d printing, artist feedback, quality control, meat)
Is path tracing good enough?

How can we make interactive appearance prediction

What is photorealistic?

Here cite our preliminary study (Interactive appearance prediction...) as motivation for both photorealism and interactivity.

Achieveing fast techniques for photorealisitic rendering important in various fields.

\caption{\fixme{Write me.}} %The red rectangle shows where we estimated RMSE in Table \ref{table:quant}.}
\label{fig:teaser}
\end{figure}


Take home points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Preliminary study: appearance prediction is important, interactivity is important.
\item Realistic reconstruction is hard. 
\item At the moments, it is not possible to evaluate how good path tracing is.
\item Tough, we can evaluate and measure parameters from the scene. Being able to compare is what it is all about.
\item Fine details make the difference, especially in geometry
\item Identify problems in acquisition, rendering and reconstruction, using the dataset to improve current rendering techniques.
\item Publicly available dataset?

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item cloudy apple juice study.
\item Rouch estimate during production
\item It is possible to apply complicated rendering models (like directional SSS) in an interactive domain
